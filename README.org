** Repurpose a UniFI Cloud Key and install Pi-hole
*** Upgrade Cloud Key firmware (1.1.19 as of typing)
*** Reset to factory defaults, reboot and SSH to the Cloud Key (ubnt/ubnt)
*** Run install script or keep reading:

#+begin_src shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/planetbeldar/unifi-cloudkey-pi-hole/main/install.sh | bash
#+end_src

** Manul steps
*** Uninstall packages used by ubnt and conflicting php packages:
#+begin_src shell
dpkg -P cloudkey-webui ubnt-freeradius-setup freeradius-ldap freeradius-common freeradius-utils libfreeradius2 freeradius php5-cli php5-common php5-fpm php5-json ubnt-unifi-setup
#+end_src

*** We're going to upgrade Debian to the latest stable version (bullseye, 11 as of typing)
  Remove old debian source lists:
  
#+begin_src shell
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
#+end_src

*** Add new source lists:

#+begin_src shell
sudo echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bullseye-security main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bullseye-security main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list

sudo echo "deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_16.x bullseye main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
#+end_src

*** Update sources:

#+begin_src shell
sudo apt-get update
#+end_src

*** If we encounter signature verification errors, we need to add the public keys manually (replace the keys if necessary):

#+begin_src
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 648ACFD622F3D138 0E98404D386FA1D9 605C66F00D6C9793 112695A0E562B32A 54404762BBB6E853
#+end_src

*** Perform the Debian upgrade (repeat steps as necessary, maybe dist-upgrade works?):

#+begin_src
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get --with-new-pkgs upgrade # (to install 'kept-back' packages)
sudo apt-get install apt curl # (for stuborn packages still in 'kept-back')
#+end_src

*** If upgraded configuration files conflict, choose to 'keep your currently-installed version'
Please inspect diff and make a sane decision - is the config required by the CK (keep) or not? (use package maintainers)
*** If we encounter dpkg 'trying to overwrite' errors, we can force-overwrite them manually (replace the deb package as necessary):

#+begin_src
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/init-system-helpers_1.60_all.deb
#+end_src

*** Install Pi-hole
Use eth0 as the network interface

#+begin_src shell
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
#+end_src

*** Start lighttpd and stop/mask possible port conflicts

#+begin_src shell
service nginx stop
systemctl stop systemd-resolved
systemctl mask systemd-resolved nginx

systemctl start lighttpd 
systemctl status lighttpd # check that its running

echo "[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1
DNSStubListener=no" > /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

pihole -r # repair pihole
pihole -a -p # set pihole webui password
#+end_src
